This script attempts to mimic the synful router implant. It should reply to the implant scanners and appear as if it is the actual implant.

Currently, to make this work one has to drop automatic tcp rst reply packets that the host running the faked-synful.py would send on a scan. This can be done easily in the iptables OUTPUT chain. Another alternative is to listen on port 80 and just drop rst replies for that.
